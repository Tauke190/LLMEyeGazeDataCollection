# Decent-X-Labs Website

This is the deployed website repository at https://decent.x-labs.xyz/ 

This repository keeps a **COPY** of the deployed website on the AWS instance.

To reflect changes one needs to copy the modified files from `home` directory into the `FlaskApp` folder.

- I may set up a git repository directly in the website folder, but for now I believe it's too unsafe.

- this repository does not contain the private API keys. 
   - this does not apply to the JS API keys (`ip-api`) since they are unsafe in nature and one can access them through website resourses either way
